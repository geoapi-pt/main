This directory has all the resource information. You should read this to later update these resources.

### zip files

The "Carta Administrativa Oficial de Portugal" was downloaded from the Direção Geral de Território [here](https://www.dgterritorio.gov.pt/dados-abertos). 
This directory has five different zip files, corresponding to Continental Portugal, Madeira and Western, Central and Eastern group of Azores.

In each download link several options appear, but the version ending in `AAd_CAOP2020.zip` should selected. 
That is, we should not download the files with `troco` because they make reference to the lines (troço) e not the surfaces.
We should not select either the ones ending in `GPKG`.

### json files

The JSON files have the detailed information of the [Municipalities](https://dados.gov.pt/pt/datasets/municipios-dados-gerais/) and [Parishes](https://dados.gov.pt/pt/datasets/freguesias-dados-gerais/) (freguesias). 
These resources were downloaded from the website https://dados.gov.pt/pt. We should search for something like "Municípios Dados Gerais".
