This directory has all the resource information. You should read this to later update these resources.

### zip files

The "Carta Administrativa Oficial de Portugal" was downloaded from the Direção Geral de Território website [here](https://www.dgterritorio.gov.pt/dados-abertos). 
This directory `res/` has five different zip files, corresponding to Continental Portugal, Madeira and Western, Central and Eastern group of Azores.

In each download link several options appear, but the versions ending in `AAd_CAOP2020.zip` should selected. 
That is, we should not download the files with `troco` because they make reference to the lines (troço) and not the surfaces.
We should not select either the ones ending in `GPKG`.

### json files

The JSON files have the detailed information of the [Municipalities (2 de maio de 2018)](https://dados.gov.pt/pt/datasets/municipios-dados-gerais/) and [Parishes (2 de maio de 2018)](https://dados.gov.pt/pt/datasets/freguesias-dados-gerais/) (freguesias).
These resources were downloaded from the website https://dados.gov.pt/pt. If the links are unavailable, we should search for something like "Municípios Dados Gerais".
